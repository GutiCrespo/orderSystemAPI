# Order Management API

This API is responsible for managing orders, ensuring data storage and enforcing business rules. It is used exclusively by the frontend and serves as the backend for an Order Management System. The system follows the slogan: **"Create, Update, and Filter!"**, allowing users to create orders, track their progress, and apply filters based on status or ID.

The API was developed as part of a technical assessment and is not intended for professional or commercial use. Its main objective is to validate fullstack development skills, including REST API design, data persistence, and business rule enforcement.
